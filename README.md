# Facebook Archive Analysis

Facebook has the option to download an archive of all the data they have kept about you including messages, posts, and media you've uploaded. I downloaded a copy of mine and started playing around with the data.

## instructions

1. Download your data in [your General Account Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account) on Facebook. At the bottom of the page there is a link that says ```Download a copy of your Facebook data```.
2. Your data will be processed and will be sent to the email associated with your account.
3. While you wait clone this repo with ```git clone https://github.com/jtloong/facebook_archive.git```
4. When you receive a link to your data, extract the files into the folder holding this repo.
5. You can use my code to build your stats and more!

NOTE: This is a very incomplete project, I would not recommend using it just yet.
